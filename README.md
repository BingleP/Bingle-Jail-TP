# Bingle-Jail-TP

To use the command, you would enter the following text into the chat box:

!jailtp <player> <time>

Where <player> is the name or ID of the player you want to jail, and <time> is the length of the jail time in minutes, hours, or days.

For example, to jail a player named "Bob" for 30 minutes, you would enter the following text into the chat box:

!jailtp Bob 30m

Or to jail a player named "Steve" for 2 days, you would enter:

!jailtp Steve 2d

To unjail a player you'd use

!unjail <player>

## Coming in v1.1

- Make players only able to walk when jailed (slow the movement speed)
- Make players unable to equip items when jailed (no weapons, sweps, etc)
- Make players continue their jail sentence when logging back in (set to indefinite)
